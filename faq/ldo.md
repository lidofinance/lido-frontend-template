title: What is LDO?
---


LDO is an Ethereum token granting governance rights in the Lido DAO. The  Lido DAO governs a set of liquid staking protocols, decides on key  parameters (e.g., fees) and executes protocol upgrades to ensure  efficiency and stability. By holding the LDO token, one is granted  voting rights within the Lido DAO. The more LDO locked in a user’s  voting contract, the greater the decision-making power the voter gets.
