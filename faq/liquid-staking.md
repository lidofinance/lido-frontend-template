title: What is liquid staking?
---


Liquid staking protocols allow users to earn staking rewards without  locking assets or maintaining staking infrastructure. Users can deposit  tokens and receive tradable liquid tokens in return. The DAO-controlled  smart contract stakes these tokens using elected staking providers. As  users funds are controlled by the DAO, staking providers never have  direct access to the users' assets.
