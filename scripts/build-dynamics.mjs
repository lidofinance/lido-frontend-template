/*
We're using some Docker runtime-level env variables.
We cannot simply use `process.env` as they will be baked during Docker
build phase, so this is bypassing build optimisation via Next.
Right now these variables are only injected in client-side application.
As injection is not isomorphic, access only works via `window` by design -
this allows developer to keep in mind that only client-side has access there.
